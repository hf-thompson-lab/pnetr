# PnET-R

The R version of the Photosynthetic and EvapoTranspiration model family. 

PnET is a simple lumped-parameter forest ecosystem model family designed to simulate the effects of climate change, disturbance, and biogeochemical perturbations on coupled C, H20, and N cycling. The PnET family consists of several models including [PnET-II](http://www.int-res.com/abstracts/cr/v05/n3/p207-222/), [PnET-Day](http://www.jstor.org/stable/4221255), [PnET-CN](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0304380097019534), PnET-Daily, and PnET-SOM. Currently, in this package, we provide PnET-II, PnET-Day, and PnET-CN. 

## Installation

The package can be installed by running the following command in R terminal:

```
install.github("url")
```

Users are also welcome to directly folk/download this repository and modify the any part of the scripts for their needs.
